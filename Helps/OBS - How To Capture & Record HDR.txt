With the 28.0 release of OBS Studio, it now supports capturing and recording HDR content, but there are requirements.

First, this is only supported on Windows 10 or 11, and only works with Nvidia 10 series and newer, and AMD 5000 series and newer GPUs.

Step 1. Install OBS Studio.

Download the latest build of OBS Studio from the official website by clicking the big Windows button.

Once downloaded, run the installation package and launch OBS Studio once installed.

Step 2. To Enable Support for HDR Within OBS.

First, navigate to File / Setting / Advanced and set the Colour Format option to P010, Color Space to Rec. 2100 (PQ) and Color Range to Full.

Click apply once done.

Next click on the Output tab, set the Output Mode to Advanced and set the Encoder to NVIDIA NVENC HEVC or equivalent for AMD.

Once done, click OK to close the window.

Step 3. Set Up Sources.

At this stage HDR support is enabled within but we need to add some Sources.

For example, to add Game Capture as a source, click on the + symbol and select Game Capture from the list, and click OK to confirm.

Under mode I typically choose Capture any Fullscreen application, the other options are optional, but the important thing is to change the Color Space option to Rec. 2100 (PQ).

Finally click OK to confirm.
